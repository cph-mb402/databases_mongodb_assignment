I got the first 2 queries to work, but didn't know how to approach the other 3 in the short time given to complete the assignment.

To run this project make sure you have your database mapped to the default port (27017), have python3 installed, and have the used modules installed with pip3. Might work on python2 as well, but I have not tested it on that version.
